A comprehensive configuration set for the Ranger terminal file manager, optimized for productivity and ease of use on Linux workstations.

== Features

* **Productivity Commands:** Includes the custom `:touchng` command for simultaneously creating nested directories and files.
* **Quality of Life:** Enhanced visual configuration with borders, image preview, and a curated color scheme.
* **Efficient Mappings:** Custom keybindings for quick directory navigation, file creation, and deletion (via a trash bin).

== Installation

These steps ensure Ranger is installed and configured with all custom settings.

. Prerequisite Installation
+
First, install the Ranger file manager and the Git version control system. This example uses `dnf` for Fedora/RHEL-based systems.
+
[source,shell]
----
$ sudo dnf install -y ranger git
----

== Configuration

. Clone this repository to access the configuration files:
+
[source,shell]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/R0tt3nT0m4t0/ranger-configuration.git ranger-config-temp
----

. Copy the custom configuration folder to your local `$HOME/.config` directory. This includes `rc.conf`, `commands.py`, and `colorschemes`.
+
[source,shell]
----
$ cp -r ranger-config-temp/ranger ~/.config/
----

. Copy the `ranger.desktop` file to your local applications directory for easy access via your desktop environment's application launcher:
+
[source,shell]
----
$ cp ranger-config-temp/ranger.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/
$ update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications/
----

. Clean Up
+
[source,shell]
----
$ rm -rf ranger-config-temp
----

== Custom Commands

The `:touchng` Command (touch and mkdir -p)

This command enhances the file creation process by combining `mkdir -p` and `touch`.

Usage:

Enter the command prompt (`:`) and execute:

[source,console]
----
:touchng my/new/path/test.txt
----

This action will:

* Recursively create the directory structure (`my/new/path`) if it does not exist.
* Create the target file (`test.txt`) inside the path.

== Key Mappings

The custom key mappings are prefixed by the comma key (`,`) for command execution and the `g` key for navigation.
